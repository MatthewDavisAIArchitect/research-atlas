# Pass/Fail Gate: Atlas Integrity

## A) Canonical landing discipline
- [ ] Each work page lists **Preprints DOI** as canonical cite-this landing
- [ ] Zenodo concept DOI is listed on series index
- [ ] GitHub is described as version history (not primary publication venue)

## B) Metadata parity (SSOT enforcement)
- [ ] Title spine matches across: Preprints, Zenodo, GitHub landing pages, CITATION.cff
- [ ] Author string matches exactly
- [ ] Keyword spine ordering matches exactly across volumes

## C) PDF hygiene (Scholar inclusion probability)
- [ ] Searchable/selectable text
- [ ] Title + author line on page 1
- [ ] References section present

## D) Identifier resolution
- [ ] Preprints DOI resolves and shows correct title/authors
- [ ] Zenodo DOI resolves and shows correct title/authors
- [ ] ORCID entry uses Preprints DOI as primary identifier (after posting)

## E) Anti-duplication
- [ ] No “competing primary PDFs” on multiple unrelated landing pages
