# Abstract (copy from SSOT `metadata.yml`)
`  This volume defines an explicit intent-domain ontology that prevents “intent” from becoming elastic language
  under institutional pressure. It constrains intent to authorized representations only—policies, contracts,
  declared constraints, scope statements, and citation/use constraints—while explicitly refusing identity inference,
  mental-state inference, behavioral inference, mechanisms, interfaces, enforcement posture, and outcome claims.
  The work formalizes representational relations required for lawful classification under the trilogy’s sealed
  outputs (Conserving, Non-Conserving, Refusal (Terminal)): authorized representation classes, intent-domain
  objects, domain equivalence, interpretation, transformations, drift and drift-bounds as admissibility predicates,
  and trace representability as a citable in-domain pathway constraint. The ontology is non-operational and
  classification-only; where prerequisites are missing or interpretation would require prohibited inference or
  operational substitution, the lawful boundary condition is Refusal (Terminal), and refusal is terminal.`
