# Abstract (copy from SSOT `metadata.yml`)
`This volume presents a law-altitude, classification-only doctrine for stabilizing ethical interpretation under
  pressure through a sealed intent-domain. It defines admissible meaning via explicit authorized representations,
  binding non-claims, and hard scope boundaries, and it classifies representational transformations as Conserving,
  Non-Conserving, or Refusal (Terminal). The work provides formal definitions, an axiom set, derived invariants,
  and admissibility/conformance clauses designed to resist mandate capture, mechanism capture, outcome capture,
  identity inference, and mental-state inference. The doctrine is canonical and non-prescriptive: it specifies
  lawful classification semantics without prescribing mechanisms, interfaces, enforcement posture, monitoring
  regimes, certification, or outcome guarantees; where prerequisites are missing or scope would be exceeded,
  Refusal is the terminal boundary condition.`
